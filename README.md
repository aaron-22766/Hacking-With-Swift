The project in itself isn’t complicated, but we’ll be taking it slow so you can see exactly how these fundamentals fit together.<br><br>**Steps and learnings:**<br><ul> <li>Understanding the basic structure of a SwiftUI app</li> <li>Creating a form</li> <li>Adding a navigation bar</li> <li>Modifying program state</li> <li>Binding state to user interface controls</li> <li>Creating views in a loop</li> <li>Reading text from the user with TextField</li> <li>Creating pickers in a form</li> <li>Adding a segmented control for tip percentages</li> <li>Calculating the total per person</li> <li>Hiding the keyboard</li> </ul> **Additional work:** <ul> <li>Custom percentage text field appears if chosen in segmented picker</li> </ul> | <img src="https://github.com/aaron-22766/Hacking-With-Swift/assets/79376206/5d425f81-3a10-4b51-8885-de677f92d1cc" width="150"/> |
