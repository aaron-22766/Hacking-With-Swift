# Hacking With Swift

Learning Swift, SwiftUI and Xcode following the wonderful tutorials from Paul Hudson over at [hackingwithswift.com](https://www.hackingwithswift.com).

## Projects Overview

| Project | Description | Showcase |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| **1: WeSplit** | This project is a check-sharing app that calculates how to split a check based on the numbers of people and how much tip you want to leave. The project in itself isn’t complicated, but we’ll be taking it slow so you can see exactly how these fundamentals fit together.<br><br>**Steps and learnings:**<br><ul> <li>Understanding the basic structure of a SwiftUI app</li> <li>Creating a form</li> <li>Adding a navigation bar</li> <li>Modifying program state</li> <li>Binding state to user interface controls</li> <li>Creating views in a loop</li> <li>Reading text from the user with TextField</li> <li>Creating pickers in a form</li> <li>Adding a segmented control for tip percentages</li> <li>Calculating the total per person</li> <li>Hiding the keyboard</li> </ul> **Additional work:** <ul> <li>Custom percentage text field appears if chosen in segmented picker</li> </ul> | <img src="https://github.com/aaron-22766/Hacking-With-Swift/assets/79376206/5d425f81-3a10-4b51-8885-de677f92d1cc" width="150"/> |
| **Challenge Day: Unit Converter** | You need to build an app that handles unit conversions: users will select an input unit and an output unit, then enter a value, and see the output of the conversion.<br><br>**Steps and learnings:**<br> <ul><li>Form, Picker, TextField</li></ul> **Additional work:**<ul> <li>App lets you choose which unit type to convert</li> <li>Using Unit types and Measurement for conversion</li> </ul> | <img src="https://github.com/aaron-22766/Hacking-With-Swift/assets/79376206/133ac535-5277-4d5b-9e70-8a0b85c5b8a9" width="150"/> |
| **2: GuessTheFlag** | In this second SwiftUI project we’re going to be building a guessing game that helps users learn some of the many flags of the world. This project is still going to be nice and easy, but gives me chance to introduce you to whole range of new SwiftUI functionality: stacks, buttons, images, alerts, asset catalogs, and more.<br><br>**Steps and Learnings**<ul><li>Using stacks to arrange views</li><li>Colors and frames</li><li>Gradients</li><li>Buttons and images</li><li>Showing alert messages</li><li>Stacking up buttons</li><li>Showing the player’s score with an alert</li><li>Styling our flags</li><li>Upgrading our design</li></ul>**Additional work:**<ul><li>Colors change with appearance</li><li>Restart button</li></ul> | <img src="https://github.com/aaron-22766/Hacking-With-Swift/assets/79376206/e859b905-ee73-4b1c-a8e8-1a7c03056505" width="150"/> |
